      "Really enjoyed the dragon roll and the miso soup. The fish was very fresh and the presentation was beautiful. Only complaint is that it took a while to get seated even with a reservation.",

      "The food was okay but nothing special. Sweet and sour pork was a bit too sweet for my taste. The fried rice was good though. Prices are reasonable for the portion sizes.",
